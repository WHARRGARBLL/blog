**Design**
The design of the blog was created with a clean and modern aesthetic in mind. The color scheme is mainly black and white with subtle pops of color to draw attention to important elements. The typography is simple and easy to read, with sans-serif fonts used for headings and serif fonts used for body text.

The homepage features a header with a logo and navigation menu, as well as a featured post section that displays the title, image, and excerpt from the latest blog post. The navigation menu has links to other pages on the website, including the blog page and the contact page.

The blog page displays a list of blog posts, with the most recent post at the top. Each blog post has a title, image, excerpt, and a "Read More" button that links to the full post. The sidebar includes a search bar and a list of categories to help users find the content they are interested in.

The single post page displays the full blog post, including the title, image, content, and author. Social sharing buttons are included to allow readers to share the post on social media.

The contact page includes a form that allows users to enter their name, email, subject, and message. When the user submits the form, the data is sent to a PHP script that processes the data and shows a success message.

The website is also designed to be responsive and look good on all devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile.
